# AGENTS.md — IA Hypermiler

Instructions for every coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, pi, Copilot). Read it in full before touching the code.

---

## What this project is

**IA Hypermiler** is an Electron desktop app that monitors AI token usage (Claude, GitHub Copilot and Codex) and computes an optimal daily budget so the quota lasts until renewal. It shows an always-visible widget with daily consumption against the ideal budget, end-of-period projection, efficiency metrics and tips derived from real data. UI in English and Italian.

**Languages:** the conversation with the user is in **Italian**. All **code** (identifiers, comments, test names, logs, internal error messages) is in **English**. Human-facing **documents** exist in English (`X.md`, primary) and Italian (`X.it.md`, secondary) with a language switcher at the top; this file is English only.

## Stack and dependencies

| Role | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript, `strict: true` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUnusedLocals/Parameters`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, `noImplicitOverride`. No `any` |
| Desktop shell | Electron (current LTS) |
| UI | Vanilla HTML + CSS + SVG — no framework, no bundler. The renderer compiles to native ES modules (`<script type="module">`) |
| i18n | No library: typed flat dictionaries (`renderer/i18n/`, `main/i18n/`) + `Intl` |
| Persistence | electron-store (with encryptionKey for secrets), normalized at startup (`store/normalize.ts`) |
| Advice agent | `agents/advisor.ts` is a dormant stub, not wired. No Anthropic SDK: #29 will use plain HTTP calls through the accounts the user already connected |
| Local insights (opt-in) | `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` — reads local Claude Code sessions via `listSessions`/`getSessionMessages`, never by parsing the internal JSONL directly (see docs/RESEARCH.md §5) |
| Build | `tsc` (three configs: `tsconfig.json` main/preload/core/services/store/budget/agents/tests — CommonJS; `tsconfig.renderer.json` renderer — ES modules; `tsconfig.renderer.test.json` renderer tests only, adds Node types) + `scripts/copy-assets.js` |
| Lint | ESLint 10 + typescript-eslint `strictTypeChecked` (`eslint.config.mjs`) |
| Tests | `node:test` + `node:assert` (no external test library); coverage via Node's built-in `--experimental-test-coverage` |
| Packaging | electron-builder |
| Runtime | Node.js 22 LTS |

**Do not add dependencies without asking.** Every new library must be justified and agreed before installing it. (Agreed so far: TypeScript, `@types/node`, `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, ESLint + `@eslint/js` + `typescript-eslint` as dev dependencies.)

## Architectural rules — DO NOT deviate

### Electron security
- `nodeIntegration` always `false`, `contextIsolation` always `true`.
- The renderer never has direct access to Node.js: everything goes through `preload.ts` via `contextBridge`.
- API keys and session cookies live only in the main process and in encrypted `electron-store` — never in the renderer, never in localStorage. `settings:get`/`settings:set` redact secrets towards the renderer (`providers.redactSecrets`) and preserve the real values on write (`providers.preserveSecrets`).
- IPC channels and payload types are declared once in `types/ipc.ts`; main registers through `main/ipc.ts` (`handle`/`listen`/`sendToRenderer`), the preload through typed helpers on the same maps. A new channel = one entry there. The renderer tsconfig has `rootDir: "."` so it can import `types/`; those files must stay runtime-free (the renderer build re-emits them as ES modules over the CommonJS ones).
- Every value coming from the renderer through IPC is `unknown` and is validated in the handler (`requireString`/`requireBoolean`/`requireOneOf` in `main.ts`). `settings:set` accepts only renderer-editable sections (`accounts`, `ui`, `diagnostics`, `updates`) and normalizes the patch before writing.
- URLs opened with `shell.openExternal` come from the main process (store/constants), never from the renderer; update URLs must start with the project repository prefix.

### Cross-platform
- No hard-coded path separators: always `path.join()`/`path.resolve()`.
- No `shell.exec()` or OS-specific commands.
- Think through every path on Windows, macOS and Linux before writing it.

### Service interface
Every usage service (`services/copilot.ts`, `services/codex.ts`) exports exactly (full types in `types/index.ts`, multi-window rationale in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §0):

```ts
export async function fetchUsage(credentials: CopilotCredentials | CodexCredentials): Promise<RawAccountUsage> { ... }

// RawAccountUsage = { planTier, subscriptionRenewsAt, quotaWindows: QuotaWindow[] }
// QuotaWindow    = { id, label, periodType, periodLength, unit: 'percentage'|'count', used, total, resetsAt }
```

When a service cannot get the data it **throws an explicit error** with a readable message — never returns `null`/`undefined` silently. No `dailyHistory` from services: none of these providers exposes it, the daily history is built locally by `main.ts` in `store.history.dailyUsage` on every successful refresh. Adding a provider = a service with `fetchUsage` + a branch in every function of `main/providers.ts` (exhaustive switches make tsc fail if one is forgotten) + a detail template in `settings.html` + dictionary keys.

### Error handling
- Every network call has an explicit timeout (max 10 seconds) — use `services/_http.ts`.
- If the APIs do not answer, the UI shows the last known data with the timestamp of the last successful update.
- Never a blank screen or a silent crash: no floating promises (`runDetached` in main, `runGuarded`/`guarded` in the renderer); startup failure shows an error dialog and quits.

### Diagnostics: automatic "format drift" report
When a service receives a response whose format no longer matches the expected one (no recognized quota window, key field missing, …) it throws a `FormatDriftError` (`services/_shape.ts`) instead of a generic `Error`. `main.ts` catches it in `fetchAccountOrFallback()` (shared by every account) and calls `maybeReportFormatDrift()`:

- **Never automatic publishing**: only a pre-filled GitHub issue draft opens in the system browser (`shell.openExternal`, via `diagnostics/githubIssue.ts`); the user must always review and submit it by hand. The app has and uses no GitHub token.
- **Never real values in the report**: the issue body contains only the response "shape" (field names + `typeof`, from `extractShape()`), never usage percentages, amounts or real dates. The body is in English (public repository).
- **Deduplicated by structure signature** (`shapeSignature()`): the same shape does not reopen a draft on every refresh. Reported signatures live in `store.diagnostics.reportedSignatures`.
- **Can be disabled** in Settings (`diagnostics.autoReportFormatDrift`, default `true`).

**Manual diagnostic report** (Settings → Diagnostics, "Create diagnostic report"): after an explicit confirmation (native dialog listing what goes in and that nothing is sent), one text file in Downloads (`diagnostics/report.ts`) with, per connected account (enabled or not, named "<Provider> #n"): the raw usage response redacted by `redactResponse()` (`diagnostics/githubIssue.ts` — numbers, booleans, null, short enum-like fields and ISO dates under reset/timing keys kept, other dates and strings redacted, any value under an id key replaced whatever its type), the settings that affect pacing (no labels, host only as github.com/"a .ghe.com tenant"), the app's reading of the data (last snapshot), 7 days of history and today's samples; plus environment, a `system` section (`main.ts reportSystem`: time zone, screens and scaling, widget size, memory/CPU of the app's processes, last refresh and local-insights durations, core count, RAM rounded to GB — never CPU/GPU models, computer/user names, paths or ids) and the last 50 main-process errors/warnings (`diagnostics/logBuffer.ts`, memory only). Free texts go through `neutralize()` (labels/ids → neutral names, single pass) and `shortError()` (no response bodies). The folder is shown and a short GitHub issue draft opens: the user attaches the file by hand, or not. Unlike the automatic drift report it **does** carry usage values; never credentials, ids, names or free text.

### Store
- The store on disk is normalized at startup and after every `settings:set` (`store/normalize.ts`: deep merge with `store/defaults.ts`, wrong types replaced, legacy schemas migrated). Therefore `AppSettings` types are true: read top-level keys with their types (`store.get('history').recentSamples`), **never** dotted paths with casts (`store.get('a.b') as T`) and never `?? []` fallbacks. A new field only needs to be added to `store/defaults.ts`.
- Background: electron-store applies defaults with a SHALLOW merge, so a new nested field used to be `undefined` on existing installations — this caused real bugs before normalization existed.

### Internationalization
- Every user-visible string goes through `t()` (renderer: `renderer/i18n`, main: `main/i18n`) or a `data-i18n*` attribute in HTML (English default text in the markup). A new key goes into `en.ts` **and** `it.ts` (the compiler enforces key parity, the tests also check placeholders).
- Main and renderer own their texts separately (separate TS projects); `resolveLocale` must stay identical in both.
- Tips, verdicts and similar are **data** (`{ key, params }`), composed into sentences by the renderer. Technical error messages from services stay English; `friendlyErrorMessage` frames known cases in the user's language.
- Numbers and dates via the `Intl` helpers in `renderer/i18n/index.ts`, never a hard-coded locale.
- Documents: update both `X.md` and `X.it.md` when changing content. The README is for users only (what each indicator is, how it is computed, how to read it): update it whenever an indicator changes; developer content goes in docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, every other document in `docs/`. Screenshots use synthetic data only.

### Code quality
- `npm run lint` must stay at **zero findings** (it gates CI). Do not turn off a rule to hide a real problem; the only documented exception is the `new Function` dynamic import in `services/claudeLocalSessions.ts`.
- No `!` non-null assertions in production code: `byId()` in the renderer, explicit checks elsewhere.
- Values from outside (IPC, network JSON) are typed `unknown` / `T | null` and narrowed.

### Advisor agent
- The system prompt of `agents/advisor.ts` must ask for **specific, practical** advice, not generic.
- Context passed to the agent: consumption of the last 7 days, current daily budget, services used.
- The result is cached in `electron-store` and regenerated at most once every 24 hours.
- `model` is always `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `max_tokens: 1000`.
- Dormant until #29; it will not use `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (removed from the dependencies in #35).

## Core business logic

### Daily budget computation
Implemented in `budget.ts` (do not duplicate it here: update this section only if the model changes). Public API, all pure functions tested in `budget.test.ts`:

- `workingUnitsBetween(start, end, workSchedule)` — working units (1/0.5/0 per day) between two dates; with `workSchedule.enabled === false` every day counts 1
- `todayActivitySpan`, `todayElapsedUnits`, `elapsedWorkingUnits`, `remainingWorkingUnits` — actual working hours: today's span = first to last increase among the day's samples (`history.recentSamples` keeps the whole day), started earlier by today's first local Claude Code session; today's elapsed part = span / `hoursPerDay`, at least 2h, capped at the day unit; calendar fraction of the day with the schedule disabled. Elapsed + remaining = the whole period
- `localDateKey` / `parseDateKey` — LOCAL `YYYY-MM-DD` keys of the history (never `toISOString().slice(0, 10)`, which is the UTC day)
- `updateDailyPoint` — today's history point with its baseline (`dayStartUsed`) and first activity
- `normalizedUtilization(window)` — 0-100 percentage, or `null`
- `pickCriticalWindow(quotaWindows)` — the window with the highest utilization (threshold notification)
- `efficiencyIndex`, `projectedUsage`, `estimatedAutonomyWorkingDays` — pacing on working units, not calendar days; projection and autonomy blend the period average 50/50 with `recentPacePerUnit` (last 3 completed working days); projection NOT capped at 100
- `todayBudget` — today's budget (what was left at the start of the day over the working units from today on) vs today's consumption; `PACE_ALERT_RATIO`
- `redistributedQuota` — what is left NOW over the working units from today on (`perUnit`) next to the even share (`idealPerUnit`): the primary pacing signal, needs no history
- `daysUntilReset` / `workingDaysUntilReset`
- `instantaneousRate`, `sustainableHourlyRate`, `efficiencyRating` — instant gauge (pace over the last hour, anchored on the sample just before it when not older than two hours; sustainable %/h spread over remaining working hours = working units × `hoursPerDay`, also with the schedule disabled; drawn on a log scale of pace/target, `renderer/gauge.ts`) and star rating
- `hourlyOutlook`, `currentPacePerUnit`, `pickCriticalSnapshot` — rolling-hours windows read in hours (time to reset, projection at reset and autonomy at the instant pace; day metrics hidden); the verdict turns at risk when the pace (not preliminary) exceeds `PACE_ALERT_RATIO` × the redistributed quota; the widget opens on an at-risk/exhausted window first, then the most used
- `chartDays` — the chart slots (last 7/30 days + 2/5 days to come): consumption, even share × day unit (thin bar), moving budget (dashed: that morning's budget on past days, `todayBudget` today, redistributed quota ahead; none outside the current period), `overBudget` (over the moving budget, or the share × unit where unknown)
- `dailyDeltas`, `deltaStats`, `windowVerdict` — daily consumption, peak/average/streak on the chart slots (completed days only; the streak breaks on a day `overBudget`, the same flag that colours the bar; days off without use skipped), per-window verdict from the redistribution (at risk < 0.5× / behind < 0.95× / on track / ahead > 1.05× the even share; rolling-hours windows: projection/autonomy)
- `hasPacing`, `repairFirstDayBaseline` — a billing cycle of unknown length has no pacing (also the tie-break of `pickCriticalWindow`); first history point on the period start day gets baseline 0
- `tokenYield`, `consumptionCause` — value per token (Claude local insights; a cause is stated only with a clear signal)
- `generateDailyTip` — `{ key, params }` from explicit conditions on the metrics above, never a generic tip; only tips adding an action or a cause (autonomy shortfall, rating, near reset, consumption cause), none restating a number already on the widget
- `resolveRenewalDate(renewalRule, referenceDate)` — only `{ type: 'dayOfMonth', day }`; `rrule` throws "not supported". Only a fallback: the period end is the window's `resetsAt`, then the provider's `subscriptionRenewsAt`, then the manual day (`main.ts resolvePeriodBounds`); Settings locks the manual field when the provider reports every paced window's reset (`renderer/renewal.ts`)

### Threshold and pace notifications
- System notification when usage passes the configured threshold (default **80%**) of the critical window, at most once per day per account (flag in `store.meta.notifiedToday`).
- Pace notification when today's consumption of any window exceeds `PACE_ALERT_RATIO` (1.5×) today's budget, at most once per day per account (`<account>:pace:<day>` flag). Only today's flags are kept.

### Auto-refresh
- The main process refreshes at the configured interval (default **30 minutes**), also with the window closed (tray only), with one `setTimeout` re-armed after every refresh. After each successful fetch the data is stored and sent to the renderer (`usage:update`).
- Adaptive pace (`main/refreshPolicy.ts`): after a refresh where a freshly fetched window rose, the next one comes after **5 minutes**; the first one without a rise goes back to the interval. Per-account backoff: every consecutive failed fetch doubles that account's minimum gap (5 → 10 → 20 min, capped at the interval), a scheduled tick skips it meanwhile and shows its last data as stale with the error. Refresh modes: `scheduled` (timer, backoff applies), `manual` (button, tray, widget opening: reuses a fetch less than 1 minute old), `forced` (login, disconnect, account changes: always fetches). Only freshly fetched values are recorded as samples.

### Update check
- At startup (packaged app only) and every 24h: GitHub Releases list (not `/releases/latest`, which skips pre-releases; pre-releases are offered only to whoever runs one), one notification per version, download opens in the browser. No electron-updater (unsigned packages).

---

## What NOT to do

- Do not invent API endpoints not documented in `docs/RESEARCH.md`.
- Do not sign in to claude.ai or collect, store or forward claude.ai credentials or session tokens (#140): Anthropic forbids it for third-party apps ([Claude Code legal and compliance](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance)). Claude data may come only through Anthropic's own binaries and sign-in (#139).
- Animations are allowed but must be switchable off in Settings, low-key, carry state, and off with `prefers-reduced-motion`. Keep them in the visible widget renderer only (never the tray), animate only `opacity`/`transform`, and stop timers when hidden. With animations disabled, only the refresh icon rotates during refresh; reduced motion uses a static refresh state. Not an animation: the tray badge's critical alert (#122) alternates the normal frame with the alert frame every 2 s while another view is over the threshold. It carries information that would otherwise stay hidden, changes state far below the WCAG flash limit (3/s), and does not follow `ui.animations` or reduced motion.
- Do not expose secrets or credentials in any git-tracked file.
- Do not use `any`. If a type is really dynamic use `unknown` with explicit narrowing.
- Do not paste real credentials (sessionKey, PAT/token) in chat, commits, issues or logs — not even for tests. See "Integration tests" below.
- Do not fix pacing numbers in isolation until the refactoring (#75) is done: a wrong value found in use becomes an issue and a case in `docs/PACING.md` (with its expected value).
- Do not make unrequested architectural refactors: if you see a structural problem, report it before fixing it.
- Do not write user-visible text outside the i18n dictionaries, and do not write code comments in Italian.

## Workflow for agents

1. **New feature:** always use plan mode before writing code — describe what you will do and wait for confirmation.
2. **Bug fix:** describe the bug, the likely cause and the proposed fix before applying it.
3. **Before a release:** `npm run lint`, `npm test`; review `agents/`, `services/` and `main.ts` for calls without timeout, secrets in the renderer, non cross-platform paths, `setInterval` leaks.
4. **UI changes:** verify visually without asking the user for screenshots — offscreen rendering works in this environment: `env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE xvfb-run -a npx electron --no-sandbox <script>` with a `BrowserWindow` `show: false` + a fake preload + `webContents.capturePage()`. Check both languages.

### Branches

Same model as every repo managed by agent-ops (full rules: agent-ops `docs/BRANCHES.md`):

- `next` is the **default branch** and the staging line: every change reaches it through a PR merged with
  **Rebase and merge** (linear history). Branch from `next` as `<type>/<n>-slug` (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`…).
- `main` is production: it only receives the release PR from `next` (agent-ops `release`, merge commit) or a
  `hotfix/*` PR, then `release --backport`. Never push, commit or open a PR towards `main` yourself; never force-push.
- In PR bodies write `Refs #n`, not `Closes #n`: the issue closes at release, not when the PR reaches `next`.
- Agents run by the dispatcher work on the branch prepared for them (`agent/<n>-slug`) and do not push: the
  dispatcher pushes and opens the PR.

### Pacing changes: spec, tests, code

Any change to a quantity in `docs/PACING.md` §3 (values, verdict, tips, notification thresholds) goes in this
order, in the same PR:

1. update `PACING.md` and `PACING.it.md` (definition, edge case, invariant, example row);
2. write the tests from the example rows and invariants, naming the ID (e.g. `D-3.20`, `I-3`);
3. change the code until they pass.

Presentation-only changes (layout, wording, colours that don't change a threshold) skip step 1. Review flags a
PR that changes `budget.ts` or the indicators without touching `PACING.md`. Until #75 closes, a test written
from the spec may fail on a known deviation (`PACING.md` §9): say so in the PR, don't bend the test to the code.

---

## Build and test

- `npm run build` — compiles the three TS configs and copies html/css into `dist/renderer/` (`scripts/copy-assets.js`). Output always in `dist/`, never committed.
- `npm start` — build + `electron .`
- `npm run lint` — ESLint, must be zero findings.
- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` on every config.
- `npm test` — build + `cd dist && node --env-file-if-exists=../.env.test --test`. **Not** `node --test dist` from the root: on Node 22 a bare directory argument fails with MODULE_NOT_FOUND. Unit tests mock `fetch`/SDK and never touch the network; renderer tests run as ES modules thanks to `dist/renderer/package.json`.
- `npm run coverage` — tests with Node's built-in coverage (counts only files imported by at least one test).
- `npm run package` — build + electron-builder (installers in `release/`, **not** `dist/`).
- `npm run package:test` — LOCAL test build (`scripts/test-build.js`): lint + tests like CI, then `.deb` and Windows packages in `release/test/`, version `<version>.dev.<timestamp>`, never published. Windows: NSIS `.exe` only with Wine (or on Windows), otherwise a ready-to-run `.zip`. The preferred way to try changes: no pipeline run; the user shares the files over the local network.

### CI — cross-platform build (GitHub Actions)
`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds on macos/windows/ubuntu in parallel:
- **Trigger:** a pushed tag starting with `v` (e.g. `v0.4.0-beta`) → **release** (`-rc` tags excluded); a manual run (`gh workflow run build.yml`, or Actions → Run workflow) → **test build**: version `<package.json version>.dev.<run number>`, packages only as run artifacts (`-test` suffix, 14 days), `--publish=never`, so no release and no update notification. No packaging on every push/PR: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs only lint + tests on Linux for every PR to `next` and every push to it. Workflow: work lands on `next` (staging), try test builds on the real machines (preferably local, `npm run package:test`), release `next` → `main` with agent-ops `release` once verified, then tag `main` (see *Branches*).
- **Each job:** `npm ci` → `npm run lint` → `npm test` → `npx electron-builder --<mac|win|linux> --publish=always`.
- **Output:** packages attached to the GitHub Release of the tag (`contents: write` permission) and uploaded as run artifacts (14 days). Release notes are written by hand (EN + IT) after the run.
- **No code signing** (`CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY: false`): Gatekeeper/SmartScreen warn at install time.
- `package.json` `author` must carry an email (Debian "Maintainer"): the GitHub noreply address is used, never a real one.

### Integration tests (real credentials)
`tests/integration/*.integration.test.ts` call the real Copilot/Codex APIs but **skip themselves** without credentials. To enable them **locally**: copy `.env.test.example` to `.env.test` (gitignored), fill the variables, run `npm test`. **Never provide these credentials in chat**: the assisted environment does not need them.

## Milestones

Condensed history; the full session-by-session log is in the git history (CLAUDE.md before 2026-10-01).

| When | Version | Milestone |
|---|---|---|

| 2026-10-01 | v0.4.4-beta | Copilot: GitHub domain per account — company seats on a `<tenant>.ghe.com` tenant read with a tenant PAT |
| 2026-10-01 | v0.4.5-beta | Copilot: personal scope reads the internal quotas first (billing report as fallback), OAuth no longer experimental; Settings tooltips no longer clipped |
| 2026-10-01 | v0.4.6-beta | Work schedule per account (inside each account detail), the old global one inherited on upgrade; fix: Copilot sync used github.com instead of the account's `.ghe.com` host |
| 2026-10-01 | v0.4.7-beta | Work schedule as the last, collapsed section of each account detail, with a one-line summary |
| 2026-10-01 | v0.4.8-beta | Pacing overhaul: monthly windows (Claude spend, Copilot) finally paced, working day from the day's samples, today's budget + pace notification, recent-pace and uncapped projection, local day keys, renewal date read from the provider |
| 2026-10-02 | v0.4.9-beta | Verdict from the remaining quota redistributed per working day; first-day baseline, phantom activity and running-day fixes; warning colours tied to the notification threshold (#13); "report usage response" issue draft; startup freeze fixed (local insights in a utility process, one store read/write per refresh), Settings loading state |
| 2026-10-02 | v0.4.10-beta | Claude `extra_usage` read as the monthly budget (deduplicated against `spend` on equal amounts), sane values on almost unused quotas, one diagnostic report for every account in Settings → Diagnostics, synthetic-only test data |
| 2026-10-02 | v0.4.11-beta | Diagnostic report file with explicit confirmation (ids redacted, log buffer), rolling-hours windows read in hours, verdict sees the current pace, working-hours gauge target with the schedule disabled, at-risk window shown first, Settings: info tooltips, locked fields visible, plan/Claude scope removed; local insights as their own section |
| 2026-10-02 | v0.4.12-beta | Diagnostic report: `system` section (time zone, screens, app memory/CPU, timings), only reset/timing dates kept; Copilot manual quota only for the personal scope, consumption rounded; local test builds (`npm run package:test`) and CI test builds without releases. First release marked as GitHub "latest" |
| 2026-10-07 | v0.4.13-beta | Absolute value under the percentage for count windows with a total (Copilot AI credits, Claude extra credit in USD; #14, #18, #21); configurable refresh interval (#15); dependencies updated, Electron 31 → 44 (#19); packages without the Claude Agent SDK native binaries, .deb 196 → 97 MB (#34).

| 2026-10-22 | v0.4.16-beta | Compact widget view: percentage and instant gauge only, toggle in the title bar (#60); pacing fixes: today's usage against the baseline at the same precision, reset only on a real drop (#64); Codex accounts without the useless manual renewal day (#95); slimmer packages, only en/it Chromium locales and no unused Anthropic SDK (#35); hardware acceleration off, tray-only PSS ~378 → ~295 MB on Linux (#99); CI lint + tests on every PR to `next`, rc tags never publish (#97, #100); pacing model written down in docs/PACING.md (#74) |
| 2026-10-24 | v0.4.17-beta | Usage badge on the tray icon with an Auto/Manual view shared with the panel and a critical alert (#33, #122); optional window animations: alarm pulse, odometer, neon refresh border (#119); animated push/slow-down arrows on the instant bar pointing to the target (#66, #125); alarm glow and blink on red values (#125); animated collapsible sections and compact/full switch, compact label (#121); renewal day 29-31 clamped to the last day of shorter months (#111); tests guard the IPC contract and channel wiring (#71) |

### Lessons learned (still relevant)
- **Codex login User-Agent**: Google refuses embedded login when a rewritten User-Agent contradicts the client hints. Never change the UA of the Codex login window or its partition.
- **ChatGPT usage authentication**: cookies alone get 401 on `wham/usage`; the Bearer from `/api/auth/session` is required. Node `fetch` works with the partition cookies + UA (probe #86, docs/RESEARCH.md §6); `session.fetch` is the fallback.
- **electron-store shallow merge**: new nested fields were `undefined` on existing stores → solved by `store/normalize.ts`.
- **ESM-only SDK in a CommonJS main process**: `require()` and even a TS-compiled `import()` fail with ERR_REQUIRE_ESM inside Electron → `new Function('s', 'return import(s)')` in `services/claudeLocalSessions.ts`.
- **claude.ai behind Cloudflare**: `sessionKey` alone gets a 403 challenge; the full cookie header (incl. `cf_clearance`) + a browser User-Agent are needed. Usage field names are obfuscated and rotate → windows are recognized by value shape.
- **Check the provider's terms, not only whether it works**: the claude.ai session capture worked for months, but Anthropic forbids third-party apps from collecting or storing claude.ai session tokens. Removed in #140 (stored sessions deleted at startup); before adding a source, read the provider's policy on third-party access.
- **Copilot company seats**: the seat may live on a GitHub Enterprise Cloud tenant with data residency (`<tenant>.ghe.com`, API on `api.<tenant>.ghe.com`), not on github.com — there `copilot_internal/user` has token-based-billing `quota_snapshots` (`credits_used`, `entitlement`), read with VS Code's rules. A github.com account linked to an enterprise (`access_type_sku: enterprise_managed`) has no data at all → `CopilotUsageUnavailableError`, not a drift. Each Copilot account has a validated `host` (`services/githubHost.ts`): the token is only ever sent to github.com or a `.ghe.com` tenant.
- **Logout reused the session**: cookies lived in `session.defaultSession` → one partition per Claude account, cleared on disconnect/remove/before login.
- **`[hidden]` vs author `display`**: a class with `display:flex` overrides `hidden` → global `[hidden] { display: none !important }`.
- **`build/` in .gitignore**: it is electron-builder's resources dir; icons were never committed (fixed — verify the packaged icon on the next release).
- **Optional parameters with a "safe" default hide wiring bugs**: the Copilot host was optional (default github.com) and `main/providers.ts` never passed it, so v0.4.4/0.4.5 sent tenant tokens to api.github.com (401). `CopilotCredentials.host` and `resolveUsername(token, host)` are now required, so the compiler catches a missing host.
- **Release tags** must start with `v` for CI to run.
- **`periodLength: null` silently disabled pacing**: the Claude company `spend` window and every Copilot window had it, so efficiency/projection/autonomy/verdict/tips were always empty there (noticed only after heavy use on day one went without warning). Billing-cycle windows known to be monthly declare `periodLength: 1` (months). Also: the current day only counted once over, so day one of a period had 0 elapsed units.
- **Synchronous work on the main process froze the app** (Settings blank for seconds at the first open): the encrypted store re-reads and decrypts the whole file on every `get` and rewrites it on every `set`, and the local Claude Code scan parsed up to 300 session files in-process. A refresh now reads the history once and writes it once (`HistoryDraft` in `main.ts`), refreshes do not overlap (one queued at most), and the scan runs in an Electron utility process (`services/claudeLocalSessions.worker.ts`), the stale cache shown meanwhile.
- **UTC day keys**: `toISOString().slice(0, 10)` is the UTC day, `new Date('YYYY-MM-DD')` is UTC midnight — both wrong for local working days → `localDateKey`/`parseDateKey`.

### Open items
- Claude quotas are not read since #140; they return through an allowed source with the standalone core in Go (#139, milestone v0.6.0).
- The testable core is extracted (`core/usage.ts`, #23). Next: the headless CLI on top of it (docs/EVOLUTION.md 2b); new orchestration/snapshot logic goes in `core/`, test-first, not in `main.ts`.
- **Milestone v0.5.0** (GitHub): rename to "AIpermiler" (#9 — userData path, appId, repo, update-check prefix), AppStream metadata for Linux packages (#10), architecture review and simplifications (#12, includes the IPC contract and core extraction below). **Milestone v1.0.0** (out of beta): signed Windows/macOS installers (#11).
- `agents/advisor.ts` is a stub.
- Copilot tab occasionally not clickable right after login (not reproduced; if it happens, open the widget DevTools and check the console).
- Verify with real use the pacing constants (`PACE_ALERT_RATIO` 1.5×, 2h minimum of observed work, 50/50 recent-pace blend, preliminary below 2 working units, redistribution verdict bands 0.5× / ±5%, `NEGLIGIBLE_UTILIZATION` 0.1%) and the `consumptionCause` thresholds, and with the next release the packaged icon and the update notification end to end.
- Tray-only footprint measured on Linux (~351 MB PSS with the widget hidden, idle CPU, GPU process the largest share; docs/EVOLUTION.md): tuning first (#99), point 5 or a system-webview shell only if it is not enough (#12); Windows still to measure (#98).
