# Development

> How to build IA Hypermiler from source, test it and package it. For what the app does and how to read it, see the [README](../README.md).

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 LTS or later
- npm
- Go (version in `gocore/go.mod`) to build the core CLI that `npm start` and the packages bundle; not needed for `npm test`

## Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suppressio/ia-hypermiler.git
cd ia-hypermiler
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` compiles TypeScript (main process + renderer), builds the Go core into `core-bin/` (`scripts/build-core.js`) and starts Electron. To use a core built elsewhere, set `HYPERMILER_CORE_BIN` to its absolute path: `npm start` then skips the Go build and the app runs that binary. Settings → Diagnostics shows the core version, or why it cannot run. On first start there are no accounts: open Settings and add one.

## Build, lint and test

```bash
npm run build      # TypeScript (main + renderer) + static assets into dist/
npm run lint       # ESLint with type-aware rules (must stay at zero findings)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit on every TypeScript project
npm test           # build + unit tests (Node's built-in node:test runner)
npm run coverage   # tests with Node's built-in coverage
```

- **Unit tests** always run and never touch the network (`fetch` and the SDK are mocked). Test data is synthetic only.
- **Integration tests** (`tests/integration/`) call the real GitHub APIs and **skip themselves** when credentials are missing. To enable them locally, **never pasting credentials in chat or commits**:

```bash
cp .env.test.example .env.test
# fill .env.test with your credentials (see the comments in the file)
npm test
```


`.env.test` is already in `.gitignore` and is loaded automatically by Node (`--env-file-if-exists`), with no extra dependency.

## Go core checks

The Go core lives in `gocore/` (its own module, `go.mod` pins the Go version; nothing in the Electron build depends on it yet). Needs Go 1.24+ and [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) v2. From `gocore/`:

```bash
gofmt -l .           # must print nothing
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
golangci-lint run    # strict config in .golangci.yml, includes the depguard import rules
```

The `go-checks` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same checks on every PR to `next` and fails the PR like `lint-test`. After the tests, its `cross-compile` step builds `./cmd/hypermiler` for Linux amd64/arm64, Windows amd64 and macOS arm64/amd64 with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, `-trimpath` and `-ldflags "-s -w"`, printing each size from a temporary directory. Import rules (which package may import which) are the `depguard` section of `gocore/.golangci.yml`; a violation is a lint failure.

`cmd/hypermiler/main.go` only calls `internal/cli.Run`: one binary with `usage`, `version` and `help` (`-h`/`--help` also work). `usage <provider>` supports readable text and the versioned `--json` contract; `version --json` reports the core build and platform. Codex is registered (#148); Copilot follows in #149; `serve` remains future work (#31). Exit codes are 0 for success (including stale usage), 1 for provider errors and 2 for invalid arguments. `internal/usage` owns the provider-neutral model, JSON documents, error codes, structure-only diagnostics and text rendering; `internal/provider` owns the provider interface and factories. Shared normative JSON fixtures live in `gocore/contract/v1/`, verified byte for byte by Go tests and read by the TypeScript client tests (`main/coreClient.test.ts`). See [CORE-CLI](CORE-CLI.md) for the full contract and secret handling.

`internal/codex` owns native binary discovery, the one-shot app-server probe and quota mapping, with synthetic schema fixtures and process lifecycle tests (#148). `internal/copilot` is the Copilot adapter, its `token`/`login`/`raw` commands and the OAuth PKCE loopback (#149), tested against a fake GitHub (`httptest`); `internal/github` holds the allowed hosts and the JSON client (10 s per call); `internal/secrets` the OS keyring (`github.com/zalando/go-keyring`, the core's only dependency) and an in-memory store for tests. On Linux the keyring is the Secret Service of the desktop session (GNOME Keyring, KWallet): without one, Copilot reports `keyring_unavailable`.

`internal/buildinfo` owns the single `Name` constant (currently `hypermiler`, pending #9) and the build-time `Version` (default `dev`). `internal/config` locates/creates the config directory, `internal/logging` builds the logger, and `internal/pacing` holds the pure pacing model. Build and run from `gocore/`:

```bash
go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w -X github.com/suppressio/ia-hypermiler/gocore/internal/buildinfo.Version=dev" ./cmd/hypermiler
./hypermiler version
```

`config.Dir()` joins `os.UserConfigDir()` with `buildinfo.Name`; `config.Ensure()` creates it with mode `0o700` (owner-only on Unix), writing no files. `HYPERMILER_CONFIG_DIR` overrides the directory for tests/development and must be an absolute path when nonempty. `HYPERMILER_LOG_LEVEL` accepts `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`, defaulting to `warn`; an invalid value falls back to `warn` and emits one warning. Logs go to stderr; stdout is reserved for command output and the JSON contract (#26). Help/version do not create a config directory. Resource measurements are in [EVOLUTION](EVOLUTION.md#update-2026-10-31-go-core-resource-budget-145).

## Packaging

```bash
npm run package       # installer for the current platform in release/
npm run package:test  # local test build: lint + tests, then .deb and Windows packages in release/test/
```

- The packages carry the Go core CLI: `npm run build:core` (`scripts/build-core.js`, cgo-free, version from `package.json` or `HYPERMILER_CORE_VERSION`; `--target win32-x64` and the like cross-compile) writes `core-bin/hypermiler[.exe]`, and electron-builder `extraResources` copies it to `<resources>/core/`. The app runs it with `execFile` (`main/coreClient.ts`, see [CORE-CLI](CORE-CLI.md)). `core-bin/` holds one binary at a time, so a Linux core never ships in a Windows package.
- `npm run package`: build + core + `electron-builder` → `.dmg` on macOS, `.exe`/NSIS on Windows, `.AppImage` and `.deb` on Linux, in `release/`.
- `npm run package:test`: version `<version>.dev.<timestamp>` (the core gets the same), never published; the core is cross-compiled for each package right before it. The Windows NSIS `.exe` needs Wine (or Windows); without it, a ready-to-run `.zip`. This is the preferred way to try a change on a real machine.
- Linux: software centers read AppStream metadata, not the `.deb` control file. `build/linux/com.suppressio.ia-hypermiler.metainfo.xml` (license, author, EN + IT description, releases) is installed to `/usr/share/metainfo/` by the `deb.fpm` config in `package.json`; the `.desktop` entry has `Name=IA Hypermiler`. Update the file's `<release>` on every version and validate it with `appstreamcli validate`.

### Cross-platform build (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds on macOS, Windows and Linux in parallel from the same commit:

- every job sets up Go and builds the core on its own runner, for its own OS and architecture, before packaging;
- a pushed `v*` tag (e.g. `v0.4.0-beta`) → lint, tests, packages attached to the GitHub Release of the tag; `-rc` tags (e.g. `v0.4.14-beta-rc.1`) are skipped;
- a manual run (`gh workflow run build.yml`, or the Actions tab) → test build: packages only as run artifacts (14 days), no release, no update notification.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint and tests on Linux for every PR to `next` and every push to it.

Packages are not signed: macOS Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen show a warning at install time.

## Security rules

- `nodeIntegration: false` and `contextIsolation: true` always: the renderer never has direct access to Node.js; every value coming from it through IPC is validated.
- Secrets stay in the main process: Claude sessions and Copilot tokens use the encrypted store; Codex keeps nothing secret in the app (read through the core and the user's own Codex sign-in). They never reach the renderer or logs.
- URLs opened in the browser are built in the main process from fixed prefixes, never taken from the renderer.

## Project status

- ✅ Real data from Claude (internal endpoint + session) and Copilot (personal plans, and company seats on a `.ghe.com` tenant; a github.com seat managed by an enterprise exposes no data, see `RESEARCH.md`)
- ✅ Codex usage through the Go core and `codex app-server` with the user's own Codex sign-in (#148, #178), rolling 5-hour and weekly windows
- ✅ Several accounts, English/Italian UI, update check, format-drift diagnostics, diagnostic report
- ✅ Own visualizations: daily consumption vs moving budget, window verdicts, instant gauge, rating, value per token
- ✅ Strict TypeScript (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, …), type-aware ESLint at zero findings, unit tests on every pure module
- ✅ Cross-platform CI publishing pre-releases; local test builds
- 🟨 Advice agent (`agents/advisor.ts`) still a stub
- ✅ Shared IPC contract between main, preload and renderer (`types/ipc.ts`)
- ✅ Testable core extracted from `main.ts` (`core/usage.ts`, store and provider fetch injected)
- ⬜ Next: headless CLI on top of the core (docs/EVOLUTION.md 2b)
