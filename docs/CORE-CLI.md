# Go core CLI

> Implemented in #26: transport-neutral JSON contract v1 and terminal output for layer 1 of #139. Codex adapter implemented in #148; Copilot follows in #149.

## Commands and scope

```text
hypermiler usage <provider> [--json] [--timeout <duration>] [--secret-stdin] [provider flags]
hypermiler version [--json]
hypermiler help
```

The CLI fetches on demand and exits. There is no server, port, daemon, shared store or pacing snapshot. #31 will serve the same documents over HTTP; #177 adds the TypeScript client. Codex is registered (#148); Copilot follows in #149. An unknown provider such as `hypermiler usage nope` fails with exit 2, `Unknown provider: nope`. Tests register a synthetic provider named `fake`.

Put the provider before its flags. Unexpected positional arguments and unknown flags are usage errors.

| Common flag | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Write one compact JSON document plus a single newline to stdout; stderr carries logs only. A standard boolean flag (`--json=false` means text, the last occurrence wins); for an invocation that fails before or during flag parsing it is recognized anywhere in the arguments, so the usage error is a JSON document too. |
| `--timeout <duration>` | Fetch deadline, default `25s`; must be greater than zero and at most `2m`. Uses Go durations, e.g. `50ms`, `10s`. Providers must honor the context deadline. |
| `--secret-stdin` | Read stdin only if the provider accepts secrets. At most 64 KiB including a trailing newline; remove one final CRLF or LF, preserving other whitespace. Empty input, read failures and oversized input are usage errors. |

Secrets are accepted only on stdin, never as flags: argv is visible in the process list. Account parameters belong in provider flags, credentials do not. Without `--secret-stdin`, stdin is not read and Fetch receives an empty secret. The CLI redacts the supplied secret from provider error messages and stale reasons; providers must keep credentials out of all returned usage fields, diagnostic endpoint labels and messages.

## Providers

### Codex

```text
hypermiler usage codex [--json] [--codex-bin /absolute/path/to/codex]
```

`--codex-bin` selects an explicit native binary; a relative path or a missing/non-executable binary returns `unavailable`, without fallback. Codex accepts no `--secret-stdin`: it uses the user's own CLI or extension login. The core runs only `codex app-server`, once per fetch, without a shell. It inherits the environment unchanged (including `CODEX_HOME`); Hypermiler reads nothing under `CODEX_HOME`, including `auth.json`. On Windows it runs in the user's logon session with no console window, so keyring credentials remain accessible.

Discovery, in order:

1. Explicit `--codex-bin`.
2. Native `codex` (`codex.exe` on Windows) in absolute PATH directories, in order; Windows `.cmd`, `.ps1` and extensionless shims are skipped.
3. macOS fixed prefixes: `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`, then `/usr/local/bin/codex`.
4. npm global locations: `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX`, then `npm_config_prefix` (`lib/node_modules` on Unix, `node_modules` on Windows); Windows `APPDATA/npm/node_modules`; Linux `/usr/lib/node_modules`, `/usr/local/lib/node_modules`, `~/.npm-global/lib/node_modules`; macOS `/usr/local/lib/node_modules`, `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules`.
5. Newest numeric `openai.chatgpt-<version>[-<platform>]` extension with a current-OS binary across `~/.vscode`, `.vscode-server`, `.vscode-insiders`, `.cursor`, `.windsurf`, `.vscode-oss` (`extensions/` under each). Uses `bin/linux-<arch>`, `bin/windows-<arch>`, or macOS `bin/macos-<arch>` then `bin/darwin-<arch>`, with `x86_64`/`aarch64`.

On Unix, a candidate resolving to `@openai/codex/bin/codex.js` is replaced with the native binary in that package's `node_modules/@openai/<native-package>/vendor/<triple>/bin/`; a missing native binary skips that candidate. Executable headers are checked (ELF, Mach-O or PE for the current OS); shell scripts and other shims are skipped. Neither `node` nor the JS shim is run. Homebrew and Apple Silicon discovery still need real-machine verification (#174).

The read-only handshake is `initialize` → `initialized` → `account/rateLimits/read` (`params: null`); `account/read` (`refreshToken: false`) runs only after `-32600` to distinguish API keys. No login, logout, reset-credit consumption, prompt or analytics opt-in methods/flags are used. Each call has its own 10 s timeout within the CLI deadline (default 25 s). After a response, stdin closes and the child has 3 s to exit before being killed; errors kill it immediately. Fetch always waits for cleanup. Stderr is drained and never logged.

| Condition | Code | Meaning/message |
|---|---|---|
| Binary not found | `unavailable` | `Codex CLI or VS Code extension not found; install it or set --codex-bin` |
| Signed out (`-32600`, no API key) | `signed_out` | `Sign in with Codex (CLI or extension)` |
| API-key login | `unavailable` | `Codex is signed in with an API key, which has no subscription quota` |
| Offline/internal RPC error (`-32603`) | `unavailable` | `codex app-server: <rpc message>`; no fresh values, no partial result |
| Call or caller deadline | `timeout` | Request timed out; process reaped before returning |
| Missing quota structure/no recognized window | `format_drift` | `Codex: no quota window recognized`, endpoint `codex app-server account/rateLimits/read`, shape only |
| Other RPC errors / early process exit | `unavailable` | RPC code and message / process exit code; never stderr |

Mapping selects `rateLimitsByLimitId["codex"]` when present, otherwise `rateLimits` (the schema requires `rateLimits` in either case). Other buckets are ignored: their meaning per plan is unverified. `individualLimit`, `credits`, `rateLimitResetCredits` and `rateLimitUpsell` are ignored too. Synthetic fixtures in `internal/codex/testdata/` follow the generated codex 0.163.0 schemas; the unknown-shape fixture intentionally violates the schema to test drift.

Windows are recognized by duration in either `primary` or `secondary`, with the first duplicate ID winning. Positive whole hours below a day map to `codex-<n>h`, `<n>-hour limit`, `rolling-hours`; whole days map to `codex-<n>d`, `<n>-day limit`, `rolling-days`. Thus the usual windows remain `codex-5h` / `5-hour limit` and `codex-7d` / `7-day limit`, preserving stored history. Other durations are skipped. `usedPercent` must be a nonnegative number and is never clamped; unit is `percentage`, total is 100. Positive Unix-second `resetsAt` becomes a UTC date; absent/null/nonpositive reset is null. `planTier` is the selected bucket's `planType` or null; `subscriptionRenewsAt` is always null.

## Text output

Default output is for people and terminal agents, **not a stable contract**. One line per window, for example:

```text
Codex · 5h 21% · resets 22:10
Copilot · Monthly credits 250/1000 (25%) · resets 2026-11-30 22:10
```

Rolling windows use `<n>h` or `<n>d`; billing windows use their label. Percentage windows already contain percentages; count windows show `used/total (percentage%)`, or only `used` if total is null. Percentages round to the nearest integer. A zero total shows `used/0` without an undefined percentage. Resets within the next 24 hours use local `HH:mm`; at exactly 24 hours, later, or in the past they use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`. Missing resets omit that part. Stale values append ` · stale` to each line. Zero windows produce `<Display> · no quota windows` (also suffixed when stale). Text provider errors go to stderr as one line `<provider>: <message>`; usage errors also print help.

## JSON contract v1

All dates are RFC 3339 UTC strings with `Z`, at second precision. All keys of `RawAccountUsage` and `QuotaWindow` are always present: unknown nullable fields are `null`, never omitted. `quotaWindows` is always an array, including `[]`. JSON field names, enum values and error codes are language-neutral; clients must not parse human-readable labels or messages.

### Envelope fields

| Field | Type / presence | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | integer, always `1` | Contract version, independent of the binary version. |
| `provider` | string, success/provider error only | Registered provider ID; omitted for usage errors. |
| `fetchedAt` | ISO string, success only | CLI clock immediately after Fetch returns, including stale results; not the original freshness timestamp of cached values. |
| `stale` | boolean, success only | Provider returned last known values rather than fresh values. |
| `staleReason` | `{code, message}`, only when stale | Reason for fallback, using provider error codes. No endpoint or shape here. |
| `usage` | `RawAccountUsage`, success only | Provider data, without pacing or history. |
| `error` | object, errors only | Stable `code` and readable `message`; format drift also has `endpoint` and `shape`. |
| `name`, `version`, `os`, `arch` | strings, version document only | Binary identity, build-time version (default `dev`), Go OS and architecture. |

### Usage and quota fields

| Object / field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| usage.`planTier` | string or null | Provider plan name. |
| usage.`subscriptionRenewsAt` | ISO string or null | Provider subscription renewal. |
| usage.`quotaWindows` | array of quota windows | Reported limits, possibly empty. |
| window.`id` | string | Window identifier. |
| window.`label` | string | Display label. |
| window.`periodType` | `rolling-hours`, `rolling-days`, `billing-cycle` | Reset model. |
| window.`periodLength` | number or null | Hours, days, or months for billing cycles; null if unknown. |
| window.`unit` | `percentage` or `count` | How to read used/total. |
| window.`used` | number | Already a percentage for percentage windows; absolute consumption for count windows. |
| window.`total` | number or null | Total quota when known. |
| window.`resetsAt` | ISO string or null | Window reset time. |

### Error codes and client behavior

| Code | Meaning | Client action |
|---|---|---|
| `signed_out` | No usable authenticated session. | Show sign-in state, not a generic error. |
| `not_ready` | The provider has not produced usage yet. | Retry later. |
| `timeout` | The fetch deadline expired, including wrapped context deadlines. | Keep last values as stale and retry later. |
| `format_drift` | The response structure is no longer recognized. | Offer a drift report using endpoint and shape only, never response values. |
| `unavailable` | Other provider/network failure. | Keep last values as stale and retry later. |
| `usage` | Invalid CLI invocation; only exit 2 documents. | Correct the arguments before retrying. |

`shape` preserves sorted field names and type names (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`), replaces arrays with one representative element (or `[]`), and uses `truncated` beyond depth 4. It never contains response values. Providers pass decoded JSON through `usage.ExtractShape` and must supply safe messages and endpoint labels without account IDs or credentials.

### Exit codes

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success, including stale values, help and version. |
| `1` | Provider error. Output write failures also return 1 and log the failure. |
| `2` | Usage error: unknown provider/command, bad flags, extra arguments, invalid timeout or secret input. |

With `--json`, usage errors have no provider key. Help is text-only; requesting help with `--json` produces a usage-error document. Without `--json`, help/version retain their plain text behavior.

## Electron client

`main/coreClient.ts` (#177) is the app's side of this contract. For each read it runs the binary with `execFile`: no shell, `windowsHide` (no console window on Windows), `--json`, `--timeout 25s` and a client timeout of 30 s, stdin always closed (the secret written first with `--secret-stdin` when there is one), at most 1 MiB of output. The binary is `HYPERMILER_CORE_BIN` when set (absolute), else `<resources>/core/hypermiler[.exe]` in the package or `core-bin/` of the repository in development. Errors: binary missing or not startable → `CoreBinaryError`; killed at the client timeout → `CoreTimeoutError`; output that is not a v1 document, contradicts its exit code, or a usage error (exit 2, a bug in the arguments) → `CoreOutputError`, never quoting the output; `format_drift` → the same `FormatDriftError` as the TypeScript services, so the drift report works unchanged; other codes → `CoreProviderError` with the code. `version --json` feeds Settings → Diagnostics and the diagnostic report. No provider reads through it yet: Codex moves in #178.

## Versioning and shared fixtures

Additive fields keep `schemaVersion: 1`; clients must ignore unknown fields. Removing or renaming a field, or changing its meaning, bumps the schema version. A client seeing an unsupported schema version must reject the document explicitly. An unknown error code is treated as `unavailable`, preserving last values as stale.

The language-neutral files in `gocore/contract/v1/` are normative examples. Go CLI black-box tests reproduce every fixture byte for byte through `RunWith`, a fake provider and a fixed clock. The TypeScript client tests (`main/coreClient.test.ts`, #177) read the same files. `version.json` uses `hypermiler`, `dev`, `linux`, `amd64`; its Go test substitutes `buildinfo.Name`, `buildinfo.Version`, `runtime.GOOS` and `runtime.GOARCH` before the byte comparison so build-time versions and cross-platform runs are supported. Every fixture is also checked as valid compact JSON with `schemaVersion: 1` and exactly one trailing newline.
